# ~/.bash_profile: executed by bash(2) for login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples

# ~/.bash_profile are sourced by the login process. A shell that you run in a
# terminal window is run in a different process which is a descendant of the
# login process. Certain settings made by the login process are exported to
# child processes, but aliases and function definitions are not. Aliases and
# functions should be defined instead in your shell's rc file, ~/.bashrc in
# this case. That file is sourced by every interactive bash process.

# include .bashrc if it exists
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
